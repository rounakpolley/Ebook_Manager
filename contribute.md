### Get your copy
`git clone https://github.com/rounakpolley/e-book-Manager.git`

or use ssh
`git clone git@github.com:rounakpolley/e-book-Manager.git`

or download zip

### Check your project status
`git status` you should get something like or with a list of untracked and modified files
```
On branch feature
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```
Also check the remote - you should get the exact same output with `https://github.com/rounakpolley/` if you are using https
`git remote -v`
```
origin	git@github.com:rounakpolley/Ebook_Manager.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:rounakpolley/Ebook_Manager.git (push)
```
If you get not a git project then...

### Initalize git VCS and add remote
`git init`

Followed by
`git remote add origin https://github.com/rounakpolley/e-book-Manager.git`

or if you are using ssh

`git remote add git@github.com:rounakpolley/e-book-Manager.git`

If you did a different output for `git remote -v` then also  you need to follow the `git remote add`

### Create a branch
First see the existing branches
`git branch`
```
  cataloge-note
* feature
  features
  master
  phpmod
```
You might get only *master that is good! Now switch/create a new one
`git checkout -b prototype`
The result will tell you that you have switched to a new branch also instead of prototype you can choose any single word

### Update your project
`git pull origin master`
```
